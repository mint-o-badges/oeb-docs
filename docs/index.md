# OEB Docs

Welcome to the documentation of **Open Educational Badges**!

## Introduction

The platform itself can be found [here](https://openbadges.education/public/start).  
All of it is [open source](https://github.com/mint-o-badges) -- including [this documentation](https://github.com/mint-o-badges/oeb-docs).

In addition to this documentation, there is also the API documentation.
There are two versions which you can use both: [V1](https://api.openbadges.education/docs/v1/) and [V2](https://api.openbadges.education/docs/v2/).

This documentation is split in two parts: The [technical](./technical/index.md) and the [UI](./ui/index.md).  
The UI documents the user interface, so how to use the platform as a user.  
The technical documents the backend. More specifically, how one can use the backend as a third party application.
For now this is mainly via plugins.
