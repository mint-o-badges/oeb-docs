# OEB docs

This repository contains the documentation for Open Educational Badges. You can see the documentation [here](https://docs.openbadges.education/site/). It is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and uses the [readthedocs theme](https://about.readthedocs.com/).

## Build

To build, run
```bash
mkdocs build
```

Potentially you have to install `mkdocs` first, e.g. by running
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mkdocs
```

You can set up a live preview with
```bash
mkdocs serve
```
